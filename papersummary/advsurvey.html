<h2> Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning Models in Natural Language Processing: A Survey </h2>

<p>Most attention is put on adversarial techniques in Computer Vision applications (>3 times than in NLP).
The most popular, state-of-the-art DNNs are vulnerable to modified samples.
Owing to black-box and overconfident working of DNNs, they are easily fooled by perturbed samples. Adversarial attacks meant for images won't work for textual data owing to underlying differences - 
<ol>
<li> Continuous vs discrete: Gradient-based adversarial attacks (orig. for images) on textual vectorised data gives invalid characters; not useful even with word embeddings. Image data (pixel values) is continuous but textual data (tokens) is discrete so input perturbation is meaningless if we consider tokens as our input space. Discrete data is hard to optimize. </li>

<li> Perceivable vs Unperceivable: text embeddings might be really sensitive to small perturbations. In fact, a small perturbation might result in a sentence with an incorrect syntactic structure or completely different semantic meaning.</li>

<li> Semantic vs semantic-less: perturbation on texts would easily change the semantics of a word and a sentence, thus can be easily detected and heavily affect the model output. Changing semantics of the input is against the goal of adversarial attack. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Attributes of threat (attacking) model: </h4>
<ol>
<li> Black-box (no info [arch, param, training data] about DNN; only access to
victim's predictions on specified inputs) vs White-box (full known info of
victim model) </li>
<li> Change output to incorrect (un-targeted) vs pre-specified (targeted) label. </li>
<li> Granularity - use of word, character, or sentence level embedding </li>
<li> Attack (evaluate robustness of DNN) vs Defense (robustify DNN) </li>
</ol>

<h4>Constraints on attacks: </h4>
<ol>
<li> Perturbation constraint - \epsilon shouldn't modify prediction of ideal DNN, shouldn't end up having nil effect on target DNN.
	<ol>
		<li> Norm-based [on vectorised rep] : no use as discrete data </li>
		<li> Grammar and syntax related
			<ul>
		<li> Grammar and syntax checker - check validity of adv. examples </li>
		<li> Perplexity - measure quality of language model. </li>
		<li> Paraphrase - type of adv. eg. </li>
	</ul>
</li>
	 <li> Semantic preserving [on both] : measure semantic similarity. N-dim word vectors p & q
	 	<ul>
 		<li> Euclidean dist. - d(p,q) </li>
		<li> Cosine similarity - works better than other dist measures because norm of vector is related to overall frequency of which words are in training corpus. Direction and cosine dist will not be affected by this.
		cos(p,q) = p.q / ||p|| . ||q|| </li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li> Edit-based [on orig rep]: edit distance is min changes from one string to other; used to quantify dissimilarity
<ul>
<li> Levenshtein dist. - insertion, removal, substitution ops on
chars in string. </li>
<li> Word-Mover’s dist (WMD) - operated on word embeddings; min dist that embedded words of one doc needs to travel to reach embedded words of other doc </li>
<li> Number of changes </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Jaccard Similarity coeff [on orig] - use intersection & union to find similarity in finite sample sets. Large J means high sample similarity <br>
J(A,B) = [ A \inter B ] / [ A \union B] </li>
</ol>
<li> Attack Evaluation - Choose metrics as per task at hand. </li>
</ol>

<p>CNN for Sentence Classification [Yoom Kim] - Word2Vec to represent input; convolve in
word sequence’s direction; multiple filters in pooling layers. </p>
<p>CNN for Text Classification [Zhang et al] - character level one-hot encoding; data augmentation </p>
<p>RNN for Language Modeling [Bengio et al] - find prob of seq of words in recurrent mode; i/p is feature vectors of preceding words; o/p is conditional prob over output vocab.</p>
<p>Seq2Seq model for NMT - OpenNMT; Seq2Seq models can generate another sequence inf from given seq inf using encoder-decoder arch; 2 RNNs - i) Encoder : process i/p and compress it in vector rep. ii) Decoder : predict o/p </p>
<p>Attention model for Machine Comprehension - BiDAF; to encode long sequences; Attention allows decoder to look back on hidden states of source seq. Hidden states give weighted avg as another i/p to decoder. Vanilla-attention models look at input seq. Self-attention models look at surrounding words in seq to get context-sensitive word rep. </p>
<p>Reinforcement Learning Models in Dialogue systems </p>
<p>Deep Generative Models - generate realistic textual data in latent space; GANs and VAEs ; VAEs - encoder + generator. Encoder encodes i/p into latent space. Generator generates samples from latent space. </p>

<i>Some adv examples' notations : </i>
<ul>
<li> L-BFGS : effective but expensive; Find minimum distance between original points and adversarial points that can make the output (label) incorrect.
adv i/p = x + 𝝶 ;
y’ = target o/p of x+𝝶 ; fixed
J - cost function of DNN
ƛ - hyperparam to balance eqn.
</li>
<li> FGSM : uses gradients to attack; fast computation; adds noise to whole image that is proportional to 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(∆𝑥 𝐽(𝑥, 𝑦)); Hypothesis - modern DNNs encourage
linear behavior for computational gains. fix size of 𝝶 and maximize cost
Apply 1st-order Taylor series approximation for linearization Get closed-form for 𝝶
𝝐 - perturbation size set by attacker; controls perturbation magnitude; sign(x) - sign func; 1 when x>0 , -1 when x<0 , else 0
∆𝑥 𝐽(𝑥, 𝑦) - gradient of loss func J wrt i/p ; calc by backprop</li>
<li>JSMA : generate adv egs using forward deriv; greedily modify input-instance feature-wise; find NN’s o/p sensitivity (𝐹𝑗) wrt each i/p (𝑥𝑖) using Jacobian
Matrix/adversarial saliency maps; more effective as attackers have control over perturbations; the saliency map ranks i/p component’s contri to adv target - how important each feature is for the prediction ; select perturb from this map
Jacobian matrix of i/p x -
𝐽𝑎𝑐𝑏[𝑖,𝑗]= δ𝐹𝑖
𝐹 δ𝑥𝑖
𝑥𝑖 is i-th comp of x ; 𝐹𝑗is j-th comp of o/p ; F - logits layer</li>
<li>C&W Attack : evaluate defensive distillation strategy; restrict perturbations to l_p norm (p=0,2,inf) & opt. 7 versions of J ; measure image distortion by max amount of changed pixels.</li>
<li>DeepFool : iterative; L2-reg algo; assume neural net is linear, find optimal (min dist) hyperplane (direction) that separates classes (decision boundary), construct adv egs using this sol; to care about non-linearity, repeat process until true adv eg is found</li>
</ul>
